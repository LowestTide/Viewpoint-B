        <div class="main-paragraph-container">
            <p class="main-paragraph-1">
               Louis Riel's trial in July of 1885 is widely regarded as one of the most famous trials evers conducted within Canada's history. However, this is primarily true, due to the multifarious ways that the trial and the verdict was politically altered and modified, all to procure illegitimate
               results, and to guarantee the ill-punishment of one Canada's most well-known patriots. 
            </p>
            <p class="main-paragraph-1">
                It is evident that the trial, and its eventual outcome was engineered in a way to exhibit the greatest possible punishment on Riel, when we consider that the trial was purposefully staged in the presence of an English-majority jury in Regina, as well as the fact that 
                these people most definitely held biased and stereotypical beliefs against Riel.  Riel was also charged with high treason, which was a charge that could be used to inflict the death penalty on Riel, due to an old English law dating back to 1342. This legal loophole was utilized, because
                 none of the newborn Canadian laws at the time held the death penalty. This once again builds on the notion that Riel's trial was politically motivated. Additionally, Riel was seen to showcase several cases of mental instability, and insanity, considering that he'd been locked into an insane 
                 asylum for two years in March of 1876 to January of 1878 previously. This was consistent with his supposed ramblings of being the "prophet of a New World", which suggests that he may have been clinically insane, or at least mentally unstable during the rebellions that he conducted. 
                 Despite this, the appeals that had been sent to the Court of Queen's Bench of Manitoba, and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council refused to process and administer the appeals. Furthermore, the prime judge of the case, Judge Richardson also refused to acknowledge any pleas, and/or appeals regarding his unkempt mental state, 
                 and the potential state of insanity that Riel may have been in. 
            </p>

                          As a result, it's made to be quite clear that Louis Riel's trial and verdict may have been influenced by external factors. It's once again important to note that his trial and hearing was conducted in the presence of close-minded English-origin individuals, who may may have been holding extreme 
                          biases and stereotypes for Riel's French, and Indigenous heritage. This could have been a compelling factor that could have swayed, and plagued the judgement of members such as the Judge of the case, who might have completely ignored the reasoning behind Riel's actions, and the motives behind them, in the end.
