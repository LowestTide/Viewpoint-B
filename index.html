                Louis Riel was sentenced to hang on August 3, 1885, and was executed on November 16, 1885, on charges of high treason. 
                His trial was a fair and equivocal trial because he was rightfully indicted on crimes regarding leading armed forces that
                subsequently resulted in the deaths of hundreds of people, and also contributed to the killing of nine innocent civilians and two <span style="font-weight:bold;">unarmed</span>
                priests. 
                His lawyers played a cunning strategy of framing and playing Riel's unstable mental health, and the fact that he had spent two years in a mental asylum, to show that he was insane.
                However, Riel efficaciously dismantled this notion by delivering an eloquent speech at the end of his trial, which completely pulverized any inclination that he was clinically insane. Riel's trial was also postponed several times by John A. Macdonald, due to unproved fears of insanity within Riel's mind, which were later checked
                by a medical commissioner assigned to him by Macdonald. Following this check, he was found to be clinically sane, thereby displaying the fairness of the trial, even by the likes of Macdonald who did not agree with Riel's actions. 
                Furthermore, Riel was also recommended leniency by the jury, which further proved the just nature of the trial.

                <p class="figure-paragraph">
                     
                    Ultimately, Louis Riel's trial was a fair and just trial because not only did it involve well-qualified lawyers in the defence of Riel, but it also allowed various appeals, to the Court of Queen's Bench of Manitoba,
                    and to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London. Though these appeals were later dismissed, the freedom in choice in the matter, in tandem with the crimes committed on charges of high treason, not only suggest the fairness of the verdict, 
                    but also warrant the magnitude of punishment inflicted on Louis Riel.
